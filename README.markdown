I suspect, though I do not know, that the things I feel are like a clustering of bubbles, empty but for what I send into them, and that as I stray through the weeks and the years, the breath of me will change -- that pain in time will become pleasure, and what I now call joy will one day weigh like strange regret upon my heart. - Kevin Brockmeier - The Passenger
